# AlgoFlow

## Introduction

* AlgoFlow is a visualizer for the most popular sorting algorithms with animations, playback speed, and the perfect sound üîä

## Aim

* My aim with this project is to provide user interactivity allowing everyone to grasp these algorithmic concepts at their own pace
* All code implementations were crafted by me in a concise and simplistic way

## Algorithms

* Currently support for Merge sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort, and Bubble sort
* Looking to contribute so more algorithms, love to hear ideas of which I should include next

## Running locally

```console
git clone https://github.com/LGeoff31/AlgoFlow
cd algo-flow
npm run dev
```


I'd love to hear feedback to make this the easiest platform for learning!
