# AlgoFlow

## Introduction

AlgoFlow is a visualizer for the most popular sorting algorithms with animations, playback speed, and the perfect sound. I created this project to provide more user interactivity for users to grasp these algorithmic concepts at their own pace. All code implementations were crafted by me in a simplistic way for everyone to understand!
